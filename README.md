# NearByRestaurants

The task is to create an Android application which will be listing all the nearby restaurants,

based on their and user's geolocation. User should able view the details, menu , timings,

contact info of the restaurants. There will be two logins one for restaurant owners, another one

for normal user.

Owners should be able to update the details of their restaurant after login.

Once user chooses a particular restaurant he should be able to navigate to it via Google Maps.

Database to be used is Google Firebase.

   
   This application is having some problems while running in android version Marshmello but working fine in other android versions .
   
   I have checked the output on android devices MOTO G5 and Vivo (Both Nougat - android version 7) and APK file has been added .
   
   Screenshots of the output has been added while running the application .
